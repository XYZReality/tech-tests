# XYZ Reality Tech Tests

Thanks for taking the time to do one of our technical tests. They shouldn't be too onerous and feel free to provide any feedback.

There are separate tests depending on role:

* [Front-end Engineer](frontend/README.md)
* Back-end / Mircroservices Engineer
* DevOps Engineer

Each test is composed of a task (or choice of tasks) and a small number of questions. 

> If you have any questions whilst doing the test reach out to someone at XYZ Reality to help.

The format of this test is inspired from [JustEat's recruitment test](https://github.com/justeat/JustEat.RecruitmentTest) and [Skyscanner's full-stack recruitment test](https://github.com/Skyscanner/full-stack-recruitment-test/blob/master/README.md).
